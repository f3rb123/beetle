# BEETLE_PROGRESS.md — Live Execution Tracker
Claude Code: read this FIRST every session (see CLAUDE.md). Work the first non-[x] run. Update after each run and before stopping.

Status key:  [ ] TODO   [~] IN-PROGRESS   [x] DONE   [!] BLOCKED (needs human)

Baseline before start: iOS grade A 97/100 (0/0/0); MobSF 50/100 grade B. Target: correct + beats MobSF, Android unchanged.

═══════════════ TIER 1 — CORRECTNESS ═══════════════

[x] RUN 1 — iOS URLs & IPs reach Discovered Endpoints (SHARED: endpoints/ips)  DONE
    Files changed:
      backend/analyzers/ios_analyzer.py    — import printable_text (was MISSING: see below);
        _scan_binary_strings rewritten to walk EVERY Mach-O (magic-byte detect: main +
        Frameworks/*.framework/* + *.dylib, cap 40) and harvest secrets + URLs + IPs;
        merge binary IPs into results["ips"] BEFORE network_intel.annotate and binary URLs
        into results["endpoints"] after extract_endpoints; _extract_endpoints now passes
        verbose=True (iOS-only, no-source-context mode); domain_intel key initialized and
        domain_analyzer.check_domains wired in (iOS never called it — see below).
      backend/analyzers/endpoint_intel.py  — NEW extract_urls_from_text() (additive; Android
        never calls it).
      backend/analyzers/network_intel.py   — NEW extract_ips_from_text() + _has_network_context()
        FP gate (additive; Android never calls them).
    Android diff (must be empty): CLEAN. InsecureShop.apk rescanned on the edited tree vs the
      pre-change baseline: endpoints 1 -> 1 BYTE-IDENTICAL (["https://com.insecureshop"]),
      ips 0 -> 0, findings 45 -> 45, secrets 1 -> 1, severity_summary identical
      (C1/H11/M7/L4/I22). No regression.
    Acceptance (domains + IP 192.168.161.138 + Domain Intel): PASS — all four criteria.
      iOS testapp.ipa BEFORE -> AFTER:  endpoints 0 -> 78 | ips 1 -> 1 | domain_intel 0 -> 30
      | findings 82 -> 82 (unchanged).
      WHAT RUN 1 ACTUALLY FIXED (be honest with yourself next session):
        endpoints  0 -> 78   <-- the real win
        domain_intel 0 -> 30 <-- the real win (section was never wired on iOS at all)
        ips        1 -> 1    <-- NOT A FIX. 192.168.161.138 was ALREADY surfacing before
                                 any edit (it sits in a text asset network_intel already
                                 scanned). RUN 1 did not make it appear; it only had to
                                 avoid breaking it — and avoid the FP it nearly added.
        PASS  firebase*.googleapis.com, httpbin.org, filesamples.com, pub.dev, github.com
        PASS  IPs section shows 192.168.161.138  (pre-existing — see above, not a RUN 1 fix)
        PASS  Domain Intelligence populates (30 domains)
        PASS  no binary-IP false positive (see FP note)
    Commit-ready: Y  (NOT committed, nothing staged — human commits)
    Tests: 780 passed, 11 skipped (backend/tests, local).

    THREE PROMPT FACTS WERE WRONG — corrected against live source before editing:
      FACT 1 — CONFIRMED. Only the main Runner binary was string-scanned.
      FACT 2 — WRONG. _scan_binary_strings never extracted URLs/IPs at all (secrets only),
        and string_analyzer._collect_files reads only text exts + .dex/.so, so extension-less
        Mach-O strings NEVER entered results["string_analysis"]. There was nothing
        binary-derived to bridge; "Do" step 2 as written would have bridged an empty set.
        Implemented the human-approved correction: extract URLs/IPs directly in
        _scan_binary_strings and merge into endpoints/ips.
      ROOT CAUSE (not in the prompt): printable_text was NEVER IMPORTED into ios_analyzer.py,
        yet _scan_binary_strings called it inside a bare `except Exception: pass`. The
        function raised NameError and silently did nothing on EVERY iOS scan since it was
        written — it had never contributed a single binary string. Fixed by importing it.
      IP PREMISE — WRONG. Proven by a real pre-change iOS scan: 192.168.161.138 was ALREADY
        surfaced (1 IP) before any edit — it lives in a TEXT file
        (App.framework/flutter_assets/assets/cfg/app_settings.json), which network_intel
        already scans. It was never being dropped. RUN 1's real win is endpoints 0 -> 78.
      DOMAIN INTEL — GAP NOT IN THE PROMPT. ios_analyzer never referenced domain_analyzer and
        never initialized results["domain_intel"], so Domain Intelligence could not populate
        no matter how many endpoints were found. Wired check_domains into the iOS path (after
        all endpoint contributors). Android's _add_domain_intel_summary FINDING is
        deliberately NOT mirrored, so iOS finding count is unchanged (82 -> 82).

    FP GUARD (self-caught): the first cut of binary IP extraction added a false positive —
      1.3.0.1 from Flutter.framework/Flutter (an OID/version fragment; syntactically valid
      IPv4). Binary string tables are dense with dotted-quad lookalikes and have no code
      context to judge by. Added _has_network_context(): a binary IP is kept only when it
      appears as a URL host (//1.2.3.4) or with a port (1.2.3.4:8080) — how a real embedded
      backend appears, never how an OID/version does. Verified: 1.3.0.1 gone, the real
      192.168.161.138 (which the app uses as http://192.168.161.138:8080/) retained.

[x] RUN 1.1 — endpoint-noise cleanup (binary-strings artifacts)  DONE
    Files changed: backend/analyzers/endpoint_intel.py (extract_urls_from_text only — the
      binary-path fn Android never calls; text/called-only path untouched by construction).
      - _ABUTTED_SPLIT_RE: a binary string table has no delimiters, so adjacent literals abut
        and the URL regex swallows them as one token. Split before every embedded scheme.
      - _FMT_PLACEHOLDER_RE: drop runtime-assembled HOST templates (%@, %s, %1$s, {…}, ${…}).
        Checked against the HOST ONLY — a placeholder in the PATH still has a real,
        reportable host (https://api.real.com/v1/%@/log is kept).
    Acceptance: PASS. iOS endpoints 78 -> 77 (net -1: 3 junk removed, 2 real URLs recovered).
      REMOVED: https://%@.app-analytics-services.com/a
               https://%@.app-analytics-services-att.com/a
               the 160-char abutted blob (…/legacy/batchttps://crashlyticsreports-pa…)
      RECOVERED from that blob: https://firebaselogging.googleapis.com/…/legacy/batc
                                https://crashlyticsreports-pa.googleapis.com/…/legacy/bbatc
      All 5 named domains still present; IP 192.168.161.138 still present; domain_intel 30;
      findings 82 (unchanged).
    Android diff: BYTE-IDENTICAL. endpoints 1->1, ips 0->0, findings 45->45, severity identical.
    Commit-ready: Y
    KNOWN RESIDUAL (not fixed, out of scope): the two recovered URLs keep trailing truncation
      noise from the string table ("…/legacy/batc", "…/legacy/bbatc" — the real paths are
      /batch). A binary literal has no terminator, so the tail of one string runs into the
      next. Harmless for domain/host intelligence (host is exact); only the path tail is off.
      Fixing it needs Mach-O __cstring section parsing (real string boundaries) rather than a
      printable-strings dump — worth considering if a later run touches binary strings.

[x] RUN 2 — CISO must not headline a LOW (SHARED: report_summaries.py, cross-platform)  DONE
    Files changed: backend/report/report_summaries.py (build_ciso_summary, most-critical block).
      Verified prompt fact first: lines 99-111 set most_critical from chains[0] OR the top
      ranked finding with NO severity check — CONFIRMED, both branches affected.
      Restructured to pick (top, top_sev) once — chain branch reads top["severity"], finding
      branch reads _sev_of(top) — then applies ONE guard to both: if the selected item ranks
      below HIGH, emit "No critical or high-severity issues. Most notable: <title> (<SEV>)."
      instead of presenting it as the critical issue.
    Android diff (only intended reword): NO DELTA AT ALL. InsecureShop's top item is a HIGH+
      attack chain, so the guard correctly does not fire: ciso_summary byte-identical
      (0 keys differ), most_critical unchanged ("Deep Link to WebView File Disclosure — …"),
      endpoints 1->1, ips 0->0, findings 45->45, severity identical (C1/H11/M7/L4/I22).
      The reword is available to Android but only triggers when its top item is <HIGH.
    Acceptance: PASS. iOS report (0 critical / 0 high / 0 medium; 36 low / 46 info):
      BEFORE: "Firebase Storage Bucket Reference — ilogistics-check-in.appspot.com — Exposed
               cloud storage configuration lets an attacker probe the bucket…"  (a LOW,
               presented as the Most Critical Issue)
      AFTER:  "No critical or high-severity issues. Most notable: Firebase Storage Bucket
               Reference — ilogistics-check-in.appspot.com (LOW)."
    Commit-ready: Y
    Tests: 780 passed, 11 skipped.

═══════════════ SESSION LOG ═══════════════
(append one dated line per session: what ran, what's next)
- 2026-07-12  Plan created. Nothing run yet. Next: RUN 1.
- 2026-07-12  RUN 1 attempted. Verified facts against source BEFORE editing: fact 1 and
  fact 3 confirmed; fact 2 partly wrong (iOS Mach-O strings never reach string_analysis,
  and _scan_binary_strings only emits secrets — nothing binary-derived exists to bridge).
  Also: the iLogistics Check-in IPA is nowhere on disk, so no iOS report can be
  regenerated. No files edited. RUN 1 set to [!] BLOCKED pending human answers on
  BLOCKER A (bridge source) and BLOCKER B (IPA path). Next: unblock RUN 1.
- 2026-07-12  RUN 1 UNBLOCKED and COMPLETED. Human supplied ./testapp.ipa (= iLogistics
  Check-in) and approved the corrected approach. Implemented across ios_analyzer.py,
  endpoint_intel.py, network_intel.py. Found the TRUE root cause: printable_text was never
  imported into ios_analyzer, so _scan_binary_strings had been silently dead (NameError
  swallowed by a bare `except Exception: pass`) on every iOS scan ever run. Also found and
  wired the missing domain_analyzer call on iOS (domain_intel was never even initialized).
  Caught and gated a self-introduced binary-IP FP (1.3.0.1). A real pre-change iOS scan
  disproved the prompt's IP premise: 192.168.161.138 was ALREADY surfaced from a text asset;
  RUN 1's actual win is endpoints 0 -> 78. Acceptance PASS (4/4). Android byte-identical
  (endpoints 1->1, ips 0->0, findings 45->45, severity identical). Tests 780 passed /
  11 skipped. NOT COMMITTED — nothing staged. Next: RUN 2.
